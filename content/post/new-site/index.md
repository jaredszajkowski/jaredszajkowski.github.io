Welcome to my website. This is meant to serve as a place for me to publish various posts from my explorations into Arch Linux, data science, quant finance, and other topics.

The theme has been adopted from the [Hugo Theme Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) produced by Jimmy Cai.

This is the only theme that I have found that checks all of the following boxes:

* Theme for the static site generator Hugo
* Includes modules for archives
* Includes tags and topics/categories
* Includes built-in search functionality
* Simple interface that is easily navigable
* Highly extensible including modules for image galleries, posts, comment capabilities, etc.

It is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
