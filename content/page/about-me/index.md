### Profile

Jared is a seasoned civil engineer with extensive experience in infrastructure design and construction, specifically within the heavy highway and telecommunications sectors. With a strong foundation in field operations, contract administration, and project cost forecasting, Jared has consistently demonstrated the ability to drive projects to success through aggressive problem-solving and meticulous planning.

After spending the first 15 years of his career in engineering, Jared decided to follow his passion for financial markets by enrolling in the [Financial Mathematics](https://finmath.uchicago.edu/) graduate program at the University of Chicago in the fall of 2022. This rigorous program, known for its emphasis on quantitative analysis, stochastic processes, and financial modeling, has equipped Jared with advanced skills in data-driven decision-making, risk management, and derivative pricing. He will complete the program in the spring of 2026.

Jared aims to leverage his prior professional experience, analytical skills, business acumen, and attention to detail to a new career in the financial services industry.

### Undergraduate Education

Jared graduated from the Illinois Institue of Technology with a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Civil Engineering.

### Graduate Education

Jared has completed the following graduate courses in the Univeristy of Chicago Financial Mathematics program:

* [**FINM 34000 - Probability and Stochastic Processes**](https://finmath.uchicago.edu/curriculum/required-courses/finm-34000/)
* [**FINM 36700 - Portfolio and Risk Management**](https://finmath.uchicago.edu/curriculum/required-courses/finm-36700/)
* [**FINM 32500 - Computing for Finance in Python**](https://finmath.uchicago.edu/curriculum/required-courses/finm-32500/)
* [**FINM 32600 - Computing for Finance in C++**](https://finmath.uchicago.edu/curriculum/degree-concentrations/financial-computing/finm-32600/)
* [**FINM 32700 - Advanced Computing for Finance**](https://finmath.uchicago.edu/curriculum/degree-concentrations/financial-computing/finm-32700/)
* [**FINM 33000 - Option Pricing**](https://finmath.uchicago.edu/curriculum/required-courses/finm-33000-mathematical-foundations-of-option-pricing/)
* [**FINM 33150 - Quantitative Trading Strategy**](https://finmath.uchicago.edu/curriculum/degree-concentrations/trading/finm-33150/)</br>
    Example coursework: The final group project consisted of developing a trading strategy incorporating the following:
    * Creating criteria and evaluating potential trades
    * Establishing position sizes, entry, and exit rules
    * Minimum of 5 different assets (NOT asset classes)
    * Use of leverage
    * Produce a "paper" in [Jupyter Notebook](QTS_Project_REDACTED_REDACTED_Szajkowski.ipynb), [HTML](QTS_Project_REDACTED_REDACTED_Szajkowski.html)
    * Produce a [PDF pitch book](QTS_Project_Pitch_Book_REDACTED_REDACTED_Szajkowski.pdf)</br></br>
    From the abstract:
    > The final project seeks to develop a systematic trading/investment strategy that takes advantage of the time-tested market ideas that the market tends to increase in price/value over time, positive earnings growth tends to increase company valuation, companies with positive earnings growth tend to exhibit upward price momentum. When companies have lower earnings, they tend to have lower valuations which provides an opportunity for the value factor to take effect.
* [**FINM 35900 - Macro-Finance**](https://finmath.uchicago.edu/curriculum/degree-concentrations/trading/finm-35900/)</br>
    Example coursework: The final group project consisted of selecting a fund or company and improving the fund with respect to macro/multi-asset ideas. The deliverables included:
    * A concise [PDF write-up with appendicies](FINM35900_ProjectWriteUp_Szajkowski_REDACTED_REDACTED_Final.pdf)
    * A [slide deck](FINM35900_ProjectSlides_Szajkowski_REDACTED_REDACTED_Final.pdf)
    * Final [calculations in Jupyter Notebook](FINM35900_ProjectCalcs_Szajkowski_REDACTED_REDACTED_Final.ipynb), [HTML](FINM35900_ProjectCalcs_Szajkowski_REDACTED_REDACTED_Final.html)</br></br>
    From the abstract:
    > This proposal examines the potential benefits of incorporating Bitcoin into the asset allocation strategy of the Illinois State Board of Investment (ISBI). With over $25 billion in assets under management and a significant responsibility for managing pension plans for State of Illinois employees, ISBI's investment policy warrants periodic review and adjustment to optimize returns and manage risk. This study suggests initializing a 1% allocation of the fund's assets to Bitcoin as part of a diversified portfolio, alongside current assets.
* [**FINM 37301 - Foreign Exchange: Markets, Products, and Pricing**](https://finmath.uchicago.edu/curriculum/degree-concentrations/rates-and-credit/finm-37301/)
* [**FINM 35910 - Applied Algorithmic Trading**](https://finmath.uchicago.edu/curriculum/degree-concentrations/trading/finm-35910/)</br>
    Example coursework: The final group project was to "develop and present a fictional fund focusing on alternative algorithmic trading strategies." The strategy was to provide "uncorrelated return relative to the S&P 500 Index through robust strategy creation, risk management, and performance metrics."
