I use nano:\n$ git config --global core.editor \u0026quot;nano\u0026quot; You can verify the updates with:\n$ git config --global core.editor Alternatively, you can edit the git configuration directly with:\n$ git config --global --edit Store credentials In 2021, GitHub disabled authentication via password and now requires authentication with a token. The following command sets up the credential helper, where it will store your token in ~/.git-credentials:\n$ git config --global credential.helper store After you log in during a git push with your username and token, the username or email address and token will be stored in the above location.\nNote: The token is stored in plain text, so use caution if that is a concern.\nCloning repositories Repositories can be cloned with the following:\n$ git clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repository\u0026gt;.git Updating repositories The local record of a repository can be updated with the following command:\n$ cd \u0026lt;repository\u0026gt;/ $ git pull Adding, committing, and pushing Any files or directories that have been added, modified, or removed can be add to the list of changes to be pushed with the following command:\n$ git add . Then committed (staged in preparation to push) with the following command:\n$ git commit -am \u0026quot;Add your commit message here\u0026quot; Note: Without add, commit will handle any changes to files that have been modified or deleted, but will not incorporate any files that have been created.\nThen finally pushed:\n$ git push If, for some reason, you would like to reset a commit:\n$ git reset These commands can be chained together with the AND operator:\n$ git add . \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git commit -am \u0026quot;Add your commit message here\u0026quot; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git push Stashing changes If you forget to update a repository before making changes, you can \u0026ldquo;stash\u0026rdquo; those changes and then re-apply them after running git pull.\nFirst, stash the changes:\n$ git stash Then, update the local record of the repository:\n$ git pull Finally, re-apply the changes you previously made:\n$ git stash apply This has proven to be very useful for me when I forget to update a repository before making edits to the code.\nReferences References for git (and used for above):\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup#_first_time https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C%3A-Git-Commands-Setup-and-Config https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage#_credential_caching https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Stashing-and-Cleaning https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-chaining-operators-in-linux/\n","date":"2023-10-16T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://jaredszajkowski.github.io/archives/git-quick-start-guide/","title":"Git Quick Start Guide"},{"content":"If anyone uses Zoom to record and later wants to access recordings of video calls, here\u0026rsquo;s a simple linux bash script to download the video file and acompanying subtitles.
