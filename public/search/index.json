[{"content":"This is the basic framework that I use to install Arch Linux, with a few changes catered to the Lenovo ThinkPad E15 Gen 2. I have found that this is a decent mid range laptop, excellent linux compatibility, great keyboard, and overall provides a good value.\nGetting started This tutorial assumes the following:\nYou are booting from a USB drive with the Arch install ISO. Wireless or wired network is detected and drivers are configured automatically. You want drive encrytion on your root partition, but not on your boot/efi/swap partitions. Configure Wireless The following command will drop you into the iwd daemon:\n# iwctl From there:\n# device list # station *device* scan # station *device* get-networks # station *device* connect *SSID* Verify UEFI boot mode The following command should show directory without error:\n# ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars Verify internet connectivity # ping archlinux.org Update system clock # timedatectl set-ntp true # timedatectl status Prep disks The following assumes that your NVME drive is found as /dev/nvme0n1. Partitions will then be /dev/nvme0n1p1 and so on.\nList disks:\n# fdisk -l Wipe all file system records:\n# wipefs -a /dev/nvme0n1 Partition table \u0026amp; partitions Open nvme0n1 with gdisk:\n# gdisk /dev/nvme0n1 Create GPT partition table with option \u0026ldquo;o\u0026rdquo;.\nCreate EFI partition Create new EFI partition w/ 550mb with option \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo;, using the following parameters: Partition #1 Default starting sector +550M Change partition type to EFI System (ef00) Create boot partition Create new boot partition w/ 550mb with option \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo;, using the following parameters: Partition #2 Default starting sector +550M Leave default type of 8300 Create swap partition The old rule of thumb used to be that a swap partition should be the same size as the amount of memory in the system, but given the typical amount of memory in modern systems this is obviously no longer necessary. For my system with 16 or 32 GB of memory, a swap of 8 GB is rarely even used.\nCreate new Swap partition w/ 8GB with option \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo;, using the following parameters: Partition #3 Default starting sector +8G Change to linux swap (8200) Create root partition Create new root partition w/ remaining disk space with option \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo;, using the following parameters: Partition #4 Default starting sector Complete remaining space Linux LUKS type 8309 And then exit gdisk.\nWrite file systems EFI partition Write file system to new EFI System partition:\n# cat /dev/zero \u0026gt; /dev/nvme0n1p1 # mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/nvme0n1p1 Boot partition Then boot partition:\n# cat /dev/zero \u0026gt; /dev/nvme0n1p2 # mkfs.ext2 /dev/nvme0n1p2 Root partition Prepare root partition w/ LUKS:\n# cryptsetup -y -v luksFormat --type luks2 /dev/nvme0n1p4 # cryptsetup luksDump /dev/nvme0n1p4 # cryptsetup open /dev/nvme0n1p4 archcryptroot # mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/archcryptroot # mount /dev/mapper/archcryptroot /mnt I use archcryptroot for the name of my encrypted volume, but change as necessary.\nSwap partition Then swap:\n# mkswap /dev/nvme0n1p3 # swapon /dev/nvme0n1p3 Create mount points # mkdir /mnt/boot # mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt/boot # mkdir /mnt/boot/efi # mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot/efi Install system To be continued.\n","date":"2023-09-29T00:00:01Z","permalink":"https://jaredszajkowski.github.io/p/arch-linux-laptop-install/","title":"Arch Linux Laptop Install"},{"content":"Welcome to my website. This is meant to serve as a place for me to publish various posts from my explorations into Arch Linux, data science, quant finance, and other topics.\nThe theme has been adopted from the Hugo Theme Stack produced by Jimmy Cai.\nThis is the only theme that I have found that checks all of the following boxes:\nTheme for the static site generator Hugo Includes modules for archives Includes tags and topics/categories Includes built-in search functionality Simple interface that is easily navigable Highly extensible including modules for image galleries, posts, comment capabilities, etc. It is hosted on GitHub pages. I followed the install instructions that the theme author provided, including using GitHub codespace for editing in the cloud. There are only two details that I ran into that he did not mention.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to run Hugo to build the site. This creates the public directory, which is where the static site files are located. Make sure to update the branch to be gh-pages under Settings -\u0026gt; Pages -\u0026gt; Build and deployment -\u0026gt; Branch in GitHub. Make sure to remove the public directory from the .gitignore file. Otherwise GitHub will ignore the public directory and your site will show the README.md instead of the Hugo site. The site can be updated either through codespace, or locally as long as Hugo and it\u0026rsquo;s required dependencies have been installed.\nOne last note, the simple command after making any changes and to push those updates is as follows:\n$ hugo \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git add . \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git commit -am \u0026quot;Updating site\u0026quot; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git push ","date":"2023-09-29T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://jaredszajkowski.github.io/p/hello-world/","title":"Hello World"}]
