[{"content":"This is the basic framework that I use to install Arch Linux, with a few changes catered to the Lenovo ThinkPad E15 Gen 2. I have found that this is a decent mid range laptop, excellent linux compatibility, great keyboard, and overall provides a good value.\nGetting Started This tutorial assumes the following:\nYou are booting from a USB drive with the Arch install ISO Wireless or wired network is detected and drivers are configured automatically You want drive encrytion on your root partition, but not on your boot/efi/swap partitions Configure Wireless The following command will drop you into the iwd daemon:\n# iwctl From there:\n# device list # station *device* scan # station *device* get-networks # station *device* connect *SSID* Verify UEFI boot mode The following command should show directory without error:\n# ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars Verify internet connectivity # ping archlinux.org Update system clock # timedatectl set-ntp true # timedatectl status Prep disks \u0026amp; file systems The following assumes that your NVME drive is found as /dev/nvme0n1. Partitions will then be /dev/nvme0n1p1 and so on.\nList disks:\n# fdisk -l Wipe all file system records:\n# wipefs -a /dev/nvme0n1 Partition table \u0026amp; partitions Open nvme0n1 with gdisk:\n# gdisk /dev/nvme0n1 Create GPT partition table with option \u0026ldquo;o\u0026rdquo;\nCreate EFI partition Create new EFI partition w/ 550mb with option \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo;, using the following parameters:\nPartition #1\nDefault starting sector +550M Change partition type to EFI System (ef00)\nCreate boot partition Create new boot partition w/ 550mb with option \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo;, using the following parameters: Partition #2 Default starting sector +550M Leave default type of 8300\nCreate new Swap partition w/ 8GB with option \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo;\nPartition # 3\nDefault starting sector\n+8G\nChange to linux swap (8200)\nCreate new Root partition w/ remaining disk space\nPartition #4\nDefault starting sector\nComplete remaining space\nLinux LUKS type 8309\nWrite file system to new EFI System partition:\ncat /dev/zero \u0026gt; /dev/nvme0n1p1 mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/nvme0n1p1 Then boot partition:\ncat /dev/zero \u0026gt; /dev/nvme0n1p2 mkfs.ext2 /dev/nvme0n1p2 Prepare root partition w/ LUKS\ncryptsetup -y -v luksFormat \u0026ndash;type luks2 /dev/nvme0n1p4 cryptsetup luksDump /dev/nvme0n1p4 cryptsetup open /dev/nvme0n1p4 archcryptroot mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/archcryptroot mount /dev/mapper/archcryptroot /mnt Then swap:\nmkswap /dev/nvme0n1p3 swapon /dev/nvme0n1p3 Create mount points:\nmkdir /mnt/boot mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt/boot mkdir /mnt/boot/efi mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot/efi Edit mirrorlist\nThe following HTML \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;—\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; elements represent six levels of section headings. \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; is the highest section level while \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; is the lowest.\nH1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 Paragraph Xerum, quo qui aut unt expliquam qui dolut labo.
