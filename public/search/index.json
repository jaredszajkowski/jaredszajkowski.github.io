[{"content":"Here are my notes for some of the more commonly used git commands along with initial setup for git in Linux.\nInstallation To begin, install as follows:\n# pacman -Syu git Or\n$ yay git Pacman will include all required depencies.\nInitial configuration First, set your name and email address:\n$ git config --global user.name \u0026quot;Firstname Lastname\u0026quot; $ git config --global user.email \u0026quot;email@address.com\u0026quot; Then, set your preferred text editor (if you have one). I use nano:\n$ git config --global core.editor \u0026quot;nano\u0026quot; You can verify the updates with:\n$ git config --global core.editor Alternatively, you can edit the git configuration with:\n$ git config --global --edit Store credentials In 2021, GitHub disabled authentication via username and password, and now requires authentication with a token. The following command sets up the credential helper, where it will store your token in ~/.git-credentials:\n$ git config --global credential.helper store After you log in during a push with your username and token, it will be stored in the above location.\nNote: The token is stored in plain text, so use caution if that is a concern.\nCloning repositories Repositories can be cloned with the following:\n$ git clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repository\u0026gt;.git Updating repositories The local record of a repository can be updated with the following command:\n$ cd \u0026lt;repository\u0026gt;/ $ git pull Adding, committing, and pushing Any files or directories that have been added, modified, or removed can be add to the list of changes to be pushed with the following command:\n$ git add . Then committed (staged in preparation to push) with the following command:\n$ git commit -am \u0026quot;Add your commit message here\u0026quot; Note: Without add, commit will handle any changes to files that have been modified or deleted, but will not incorporate any files that have been created.\nThen finally pushed:\n$ git push If, for some reason, you would like to reset a commit:\n$ git reset These commands can be chained together with the AND operator:\n$ git add . \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git commit -am \u0026quot;Add your commit message here\u0026quot; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git push References References for git (and used for above):\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup#_first_time https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C%3A-Git-Commands-Setup-and-Config https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage#_credential_caching https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-chaining-operators-in-linux/\n","date":"2023-10-16T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://jaredszajkowski.github.io/archives/git-quick-start-guide/","title":"Git Quick Start Guide"},{"content":"If anyone uses Zoom to record and later wants to access recordings of video calls, here\u0026rsquo;s a simple linux bash script to download the video file and acompanying subtitles. For a long time I used zoomdl, but it is no longer under active development, and I began running into various issues about a year ago.\nThis tutorial requires you to have a \u0026ldquo;cookies\u0026rdquo; text file, which needs to contain the cookies export in the Netscape HTTP format of the Zoom cookies after logging in.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the steps to setting this up:\nStep 1 - Install cookie editor Install the cookie editor extension. I personnally use it with Microsoft Edge, but there are similar extensions for Chrome, Firefox, etc.\nStep 2 - Modify export format Change the preferred cookie export format to Netscape HTTP Cookie File in the extension options. It is necessary to export in this format, otherwise yt-dlp will not be able to read the cookies.txt file correctly.\nStep 3 - Log in to Zoom Log in to Zoom in your browser. Be sure to remain logged in while exporting the cookies under step 4.\nStep 4 - Export cookies The export button is at the top fo the window. It copies the cookies to your clipboard, which then need to be pasted into a text file (I have my saved as cookies.txt), which yt-dlp will then read when it executes.\nStep 5 - Create bash script Save the following code to a text file (my bash script file name is yt-dlp.sh):\n1 2 3 4 5 6 #!/bin/bash echo What is the link? read link yt-dlp --referer \u0026#34;https://zoom.us/\u0026#34; --cookies /path/to/cookies/file/cookies.txt -o \u0026#34;%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s\u0026#34; --write-subs $link Step 6 - Change permissions Modify the permissions of the bash script to allow execution:\n$ chmod +x yt-dlp.sh Step 7 - Execute the script Execute the bash script with ./yt-dlp.sh, copy and paste the link to the video that you would like to save, and it should download the video and the subtitles.\n","date":"2023-10-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://jaredszajkowski.github.io/archives/using-yt-dlp-with-zoom/","title":"Using yt-dlp With Zoom"},{"content":"This is the basic framework that I use to install Arch Linux, with a few changes catered to the Lenovo ThinkPad E15 Gen 2. I have found that this is a decent mid range laptop, excellent linux compatibility, great keyboard, and overall provides a good value.\nGetting started This tutorial assumes the following:\nYou are booting from a USB drive with the Arch install ISO. Wireless or wired network is detected and drivers are configured automatically. You want drive encrytion on your root partition, but not on your boot/efi/swap partitions. Configure Wireless The following command will drop you into the iwd daemon:\n# iwctl From there:\n# device list # station *device* scan # station *device* get-networks # station *device* connect *SSID* Verify UEFI boot mode The following command should show directory without error:\n# ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars Verify internet connectivity # ping archlinux.org Update system clock # timedatectl set-ntp true # timedatectl status Prep disks The following assumes that your NVME drive is found as /dev/nvme0n1. Partitions will then be /dev/nvme0n1p1 and so on.\nList disks:\n# fdisk -l Wipe all file system records:\n# wipefs -a /dev/nvme0n1 Partition table \u0026amp; partitions Open nvme0n1 with gdisk:\n# gdisk /dev/nvme0n1 Create GPT partition table with option \u0026ldquo;o\u0026rdquo;.\nCreate EFI partition Create new EFI partition w/ 550mb with option \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo;, using the following parameters:\nPartition #1\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; Default starting sector\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; +550M\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; Change partition type to EFI System (ef00) Create boot partition Create new boot partition w/ 550mb with option \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo;, using the following parameters:\nPartition #2\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; Default starting sector\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; +550M\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; Leave default type of 8300 Create swap partition The old rule of thumb used to be that a swap partition should be the same size as the amount of memory in the system, but given the typical amount of memory in modern systems this is obviously no longer necessary. For my system with 16 or 32 GB of memory, a swap of 8 GB is rarely even used.\nCreate new Swap partition w/ 8GB with option \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo;, using the following parameters:\nPartition #3\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; Default starting sector\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; +8G\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; Change to linux swap (8200) Create root partition Create new root partition w/ remaining disk space with option \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo;, using the following parameters:\nPartition #4\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; Default starting sector\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; Complete remaining space\u0026lt;/br\u0026gt; Linux LUKS type 8309 And then exit gdisk.\nWrite file systems EFI partition Write file system to new EFI System partition:\n# cat /dev/zero \u0026gt; /dev/nvme0n1p1 # mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/nvme0n1p1 Boot partition Then boot partition:\n# cat /dev/zero \u0026gt; /dev/nvme0n1p2 # mkfs.ext2 /dev/nvme0n1p2 Root partition Prepare root partition w/ LUKS:\n# cryptsetup -y -v luksFormat --type luks2 /dev/nvme0n1p4 # cryptsetup luksDump /dev/nvme0n1p4 # cryptsetup open /dev/nvme0n1p4 archcryptroot # mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/archcryptroot # mount /dev/mapper/archcryptroot /mnt I use archcryptroot for the name of my encrypted volume, but change as necessary.\nSwap partition Then swap:\n# mkswap /dev/nvme0n1p3 # swapon /dev/nvme0n1p3 Create mount points # mkdir /mnt/boot # mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt/boot # mkdir /mnt/boot/efi # mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot/efi Install system To be continued.\n","date":"2023-09-29T00:00:01Z","permalink":"https://jaredszajkowski.github.io/archives/arch-linux-laptop-install/","title":"Arch Linux Laptop Install"},{"content":"Welcome to my website. This is meant to serve as a place for me to publish various posts from my explorations into Arch Linux, data science, quant finance, and other topics.\nThe theme has been adopted from the Hugo Theme Stack produced by Jimmy Cai.\nThis is the only theme that I have found that checks all of the following boxes:\nTheme for the static site generator Hugo Includes modules for archives Includes tags and topics/categories Includes built-in search functionality Simple interface that is easily navigable Highly extensible including modules for image galleries, posts, comment capabilities, etc. It is hosted on GitHub pages. I followed the install instructions that the theme author provided, including using GitHub codespace for editing in the cloud. There are only a few details that I ran into that he did not mention.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to run Hugo to build the site. This creates the public directory, which is where the static site files are located. Make sure to update the branch to be gh-pages under Settings -\u0026gt; Pages -\u0026gt; Build and deployment -\u0026gt; Branch in GitHub. Make sure to remove the public directory from the .gitignore file. Otherwise GitHub will ignore the public directory and your site will show the README.md instead of the Hugo site. The site can be updated either through codespace, or locally as long as Hugo and it\u0026rsquo;s required dependencies have been installed.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the full list of resources I referenced for deploying Hugo with GitHub pages:\nhttps://www.o11ycloud.com/posts/gh_hugo/ https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack https://medium.com/@magstherdev/github-pages-hugo-86ae6bcbadd\nOne last note, the simple command after making any changes and to push those updates is as follows:\n$ hugo \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git add . \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git commit -am \u0026quot;Updating site\u0026quot; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git push ","date":"2023-09-26T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://jaredszajkowski.github.io/archives/hello-world/","title":"Hello World"}]
